History stuff:
First, this repo was created at github.
Next, I've created a local repo (`git init`; `git remote add origin https://github.com/YakovL/-git-github.git`),
  created this file, added it (`git add '.\collecting notes.txt'`; `git commit -m "add the main file"`),
  pushed to github (`git push -u origin master`; an unexpected UI appeared for credentials input).
I've edited this file at github â€“ made 3 commits. Commiting directly to the master branch.
To update the local repo, I've used `git pull origin master`; updated this text accordingly; added and commited
 (`git commit -a -m "describe local repo updating"`); pushed again.

Targets, questions, next steps:
* try stuff suggested by Mario, add branches with various updates to TWc core, make pull requests
* create another GitHub account, "collaborate" on this doc (pull request - pull)
* learn how to make this file ~look formatted~:
** at github (man, I don't like that code bits look the same as ordinary text here, it's a git/github notes hub!)
** locally.. preferrably in form of a TiddlyWiki
* simplify workflow: for now, editing requires an opened shell/cmd for git stuff, an editor for the file, optionally a file manager and also a browser if we want to check the result
** what's more important, this is not automated, so I have to remember to push/pull after each edit
** it's not handy to open shell/cmd after reopening a file from "recent" (see notepad++ extensions, though)

Goals:
* CS: ...
* TWc core: clean up the fork repo, add a branch for each proposed core change, make all pull requests
* MTS: publish at GitHub + incorporate git support for content + secure autoupdate + [what if someone contributes?]
* TWc extensions: publish at GitHub + update by request directly from TW (+MTS) + [what if someone contributes? especially to a cooked plugin]
* create an introductory to git/github/+TWc doc for collaborators

Other notes:
* looks like github doesn't allow to put several edits to one commit, each file edit makes a commit
* GitHub suggests adding to repository:
** README: https://github.com/YakovL/-git-github/new/master?readme=1
** LICENSE: https://github.com/YakovL/-git-github/new/master?filename=LICENSE.md
** .gitignore: https://github.com/YakovL/-git-github/new/master?filename=.gitignore

History stuff:
First, this repo was created at github.
Next, I've created a local repo (git init ; git remote add origin https://github.com/YakovL/-git-github.git),
  created this file, added it (git add '.\collecting notes.txt' ; git commit -m "add the main file"),
  pushed here (git push -u origin master ; an unexpected UI appeared for credentials input).
Now, I've edited this file at github â€“ made a couple of commits. Commiting directly to the master branch.

Targets, questions, next steps:
* learn how to update the local repo (this file is still empty there)
* learn how to make this file ~look formatted~:
** at github (man, I don't like that code bits look the same as ordinary text here, it's a git/github notes hub!)
** locally.. preferrably in form of a TiddlyWiki

Other notes:
* looks like github doesn't allow to put several edits to one commit, each file edit makes a commit

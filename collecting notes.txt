History stuff:
First, this repo was created at github.
Next, I've created a local repo (`git init`; `git remote add origin https://github.com/YakovL/-git-github.git`),
  created this file, added it (`git add '.\collecting notes.txt'`; `git commit -m "add the main file"`),
  pushed to github (`git push -u origin master`; an unexpected UI appeared for credentials input).
I've edited this file at github – made 3 commits. Commiting directly to the master branch.
To update the local repo, I've used `git pull origin master`; updated this text accordingly; added and commited
 (`git commit -a -m "describe local repo updating"`); pushed again.

Targets, questions, next steps:
* learn how to update the local repo (this file is still empty there)
* learn how to make this file ~look formatted~:
** at github (man, I don't like that code bits look the same as ordinary text here, it's a git/github notes hub!)
** locally.. preferrably in form of a TiddlyWiki
* simplify workflow: for now, editing requires an opened shell/cmd for git stuff, an editor for the file, optionally a file manager and also a browser if we want to check the result

Goals:
* CS: ...
* TW core: ...
* MTS: ...
* TW extensions: ...

Other notes:
* looks like github doesn't allow to put several edits to one commit, each file edit makes a commit
